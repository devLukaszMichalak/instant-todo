# Instant todos

A project motivated by the fact that my girlfriend always sends me shopping lists in plain text and needed a fast parser that would give me a nice list with checkboxes. I also wanted to give React a try.

Check it out here: https://instant-todos.web.app/share/QnJlYWQlMEFtaWxrJTBBY2hvY29sYXRl?2=x

It's a PWA, so feel free to install it

## Guide

1. Paste the text and submit
2. Done. Your todos are ready

You can share the link and the whole state of the to-do list will be remembered!
Keep in mind that editing resets the state
