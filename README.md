# Instant todos

A project motivated by the fact that my girlfriend always sends me shopping lists in plain text and needed a fast parser that would give me a nice list with checkboxes. I also wanted to give React a try.

Check it out here: https://instant-todos.web.app/

## Gude

1. Paste the text and submit
2. Done. You're todos are ready
